<h1>Epic Zoomer (Minecraft Mod)</h1>
<h3>A simple legacy Forge mod that adds a zoom functionality into the game.</h3>
<h1>Why use it instead of Optifine's zoom?</h1>
<h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Scroll to zoom more/less</li>
        <li>Smooth zoom</li>
    </ul>
</h3>
(+ if you have a mod that's incompatible with Optifine, you can still have this
one)
