<h1>Can I Jailbreak</h1>
A "simple" website that tells you if your device is jailbreakable or not.
<h2>THIS WEBSITE IS HEAVILY OUTDATED AS OF WRITING THIS NOTE.</h2>
<h2>Info should still be fairly accurate for ios &lE;14</h2>
<h3>Only jailbreaks on iOS 15 for now are:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Xina (rootfull, 15.0-15.1.1)</li>
    <li>Dopamine (rootless, 15.0-15.4.1)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Please don't use the website as an absolute reference until it's been eventually rewritten</h2>
